Ben Telford Visuals was founded in June of 2017, beginning as a small-scale production company focusing solely on music videos for artists in the Ottawa area. In the 2+ years since then, we have gone on to produce commercials, short films, documentaries, event coverages, interviews, and music videos for artists and businesses across Ontario. These projects currently amass to a total of over 900k youtube views. By coming to us for your video production needs, not only will you get unmatched expertise and equipment, you will also receive services from people who share a genuine love for their craft.

<br>
Our company is owned and operated by Ben Telford, and based out of Ottawa, Ontario. Ben personally oversees the production of all contracts, to ensure that every video meets our strict set of expectations. To achieve this, the majority of all screen-writing, direction, cinematography, and post-production is handled in-house. This allows us to build a healthy working relationship with our clients, allowing them to be involved every step of the way, unlike most production companies. Our favourite part of video production is telling a story. Whether it be through promoting your product, exhibiting your art, or capturing your special event, leave it to Ben Telford Visuals to do it right.

Your life is already a movie, we just capture it for you.
